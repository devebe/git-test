Hello!

This is my first attempt at weathering the storm we call development. I hope it wont be a long Odyssey, but one can never be too sure. Let's see if I can make apps of my own in a few months.

I wish myself and you good luck and fortune.

I just heard about the University of Wageningen that they are developing cauliflower nuggets to replace chicken nuggets for younger adolescents.
